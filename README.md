# What is Nyctophobia?
-----------------------
Nyctophobia is a top-down 2D Horror game that capitalizes on the fear of the dark and giving the player a feeling of uselessness in limiting their capabilities. You play as
a wandering person who holds no recollection of how they ended up where they are and whether or not they are alone. Armed with only a flashlight, you must find a way out
using your wits. Can you escape the night or will it claim another soul in the process?
Following Scream-Jam's idea's of horror, we included a variety of "fun" features to mess with the player and terrify them such as: random jumpscares, limited vision, and 
an evil entity who constantly pursues and tries to kill you. We also aimed to provide more feelings of immersion in the game such as providing audio cues for some interactions, 
animations for both the player and the killer, and an inventory system to keep track of the stuff you have collected.
We are all very proud of this project and we hope that you will enjoy Nyctophobia!
